Absolutely, Vrutikkk! Here's a complete **recap of whatâ€™s done** till **Step 05**, followed by a breakdown of **what's coming next** and the **final feature roadmap** of your Excel clone project.

---

## âœ… **Progress Recap Till Step 05**

### âœ… Step 01: Project Setup

* Created base HTML and CSS layout.
* Defined three separate canvas layers:

  * `excelCanvas` (main grid),
  * `headerCanvas` (top column headers),
  * `indexCanvas` (left row indexes).
* Proper scrollable container with `canvas-wrapper`.

---

### âœ… Step 02: Grid Rendering Logic

* Implemented `Grid` class.
* Calculated visible cell ranges using scroll position.
* Dynamically rendered horizontal and vertical lines (grid).
* Added pixel-perfect precision using `0.5` line offset.

---

### âœ… Step 03: Device Pixel Ratio (DPR) Handling

* Scaled canvas drawing using `devicePixelRatio` for sharp lines on high-DPI displays.
* Added a general `_setupCanvas` method to avoid repetition.

---

### âœ… Step 04: Fixed Headers & Indexes

* Rendered column headers (`A`, `B`, `C`...) and row indexes (`1`, `2`, `3`...) on their respective canvases.
* Synced scrolling so they stay fixed during vertical/horizontal scrolling.
* Top-left corner border and canvas alignment issues were resolved.
* Used `z-index` and canvas `position` correctly to avoid overlapping with scrollbars.

---

### âœ… Step 05: Data Model Integration (Split into 3 Parts)

* **Part 1:** Added internal `this.data` model using `{ "row:col": { value, style } }` format.
* **Part 2:** Rendered cell values on main canvas with support for bold/italic text.
* **Part 3:** Refactored full code:

  * Separated styling logic in `_cellStyle`.
  * Avoided duplicated `setTransform`, `scale`, etc.
  * Consolidated repeated code into `_setupCanvas`.
  * Applied precise DPR-aware strokes (`1 / dpr`).
  * Moved fixed top/left borders from header/index canvas to `excelCanvas`.

## ðŸ”® What's Coming Next

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 06: **Cell Selection**

> We'll implement mouse-based and keyboard-based cell selection.

* Clicking a cell highlights it.
* Arrow key navigation.
* Selecting ranges (Shift + click or drag).
* Rendering selection box.
* Syncing selection with headers and indexes for better UX.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 07: **Cell Editing**

> Double click or `Enter` key enables in-place cell editing.

* Floating input box appears on top of the selected cell.
* On `Enter`, value is committed to the grid data model.
* Escape to cancel editing.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 08: **Multiple Selection & Range Highlight**

* Select multiple rows/columns.
* Mouse drag selection for a rectangular group of cells.
* Highlight the selected block visually.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 09: **Insert/Delete Row & Column**

> Excel-like UI buttons or right-click menu to:

* Insert row above/below.
* Delete row.
* Insert column left/right.
* Delete column.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 10: **Styling Features**

> Add support for:

* Bold, Italic, Underline toggles.
* Font size, color changes.
* Background cell color.
* Apply style to selected cell(s).

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 11: **Formula Support**

> Basic formula parsing:

* Start with `=` support for basic formulas like `=A1+B2`.
* Parse cell references and evaluate.
* Show computed result in the cell.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 12: **Context Menu / Toolbar**

* Right-click options for formatting/editing.
* Top/bottom toolbar for cell actions.
* Excel-style quick-access UI.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 13: **Saving and Loading**

* Download/upload `.json` files of the current sheet.
* Export to `.csv`.

---

### ðŸŸ¦ Step 14: **Multiple Sheet Support**

* Add tab-based sheet navigation.
* Maintain data for each sheet separately.
