Task 8
Coding guidelines
-----------------
1. Make sure you have comments over every function and every class variable you use
 
For example

    /**
    * Intializes the Person object
    *@param {String} firstName FirstName of the person
    *@param {String} lastName Last Name of the person
    *@param {Number} age The age of the person
    **/
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age)
    {
         /**@type {String} Stores the firstName of the person*/
        this.firstName = firstName;
        /**@type {Number} Stores the age of the person*/
        this.age = age;
    }

}
