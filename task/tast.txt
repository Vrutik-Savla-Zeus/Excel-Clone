Task 8
Coding guidelines
-----------------
1. Make sure you have comments over every function and every class variable you use
 
For example
class Person {
 
    /**
    * Intializes the Person object
    *@param {String} firstName FirstName of the person
    *@param {String} lastName Last Name of the person
    *@param {number} age The age of the person
    **/
    constructor(firstName, lastName, age)
    {
         /**@type {string} Stores the firstName of the person*/
        this.firstName = firstName;
        /**@type {number} Stores the age of the person*/
        this.age = age;
    }

}
 
 
1. Look at how excel grid works
Features to implement
---------------------
Use html canvas to great this excel grid.
 

FEATURES:
1. Support 1 lakh rows and 500 columns
2. Column resizing should be supported
3. Row resizing should be supported
4. Editing of a cell.
5. Load json data of the following format
    {
        id: 1,
        firstName : Raj,
        lastName : Solanki
        Age: 30
        Salary: 1000000
    }
 
    Generate 50000 records with different values and store them in the json.
    Load them in the excel sheet.
6. Support column selection
7. Support row selection
8. Support cell-range selection
9. Compute count, min, max, sum and average of selected cells if they have numbers.
10. Insert column & insert rows
11. select rows and columns through mouse and keyboard
 





Please make sure we create separate classes for 
1. grid
2. Try and create a separate class for each action that you perform.
    For eg: 
            Class for rows and columns
            Class for cells
            Class for selection
            Class for cell ranges           
            Optimize data storage.
3. The actions should be implemented in the form of command pattern. This will automatically support undo-redo.
 
Actions like typing, column resizing, row resizing should be a part of undo - redo.
 
Match the look and feel of the excel grid. Carefully look at the line thickness.
